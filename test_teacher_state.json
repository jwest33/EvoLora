    "Generate a math WORD PROBLEM with a real-world context (not just \"What is X + Y?\").\n\nThe problem must:\n1. Tell a story or describe a real situation\n2. Involve people, objects, or scenarios\n3. Require mathematical reasoning to solve\n\nFormat EXACTLY as follows:\nQuestion: [A complete word problem with context]\nAnswer: [Step-by-step solution with calculations in <<>> brackets, final answer in \\boxed{}]\n\nExample:\nQuestion: Sarah has 15 apples. She gives 3 to her friend and buys 7 more. How many apples does she have?\nAnswer: Sarah starts with 15 apples.\nShe gives away 3, so she has 15 - 3 = <<15-3=12>>12 apples.\nShe buys 7 more, so she has 12 + 7 = <<12+7=19>>19 apples.\nTherefore, Sarah has \\boxed{19} apples.\n\nGenerate ONE word problem:",
