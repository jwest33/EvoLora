      "question": "Maya is planning a community garden and wants to divide a rectangular plot of land measuring 60 meters long and 40 meters wide into identical square sections for different types of vegetables. She wants each square section to be as large as possible while still fitting evenly into the garden\u2019s dimensions. She also plans to install a walking path 1 meter wide around the entire perimeter of the garden, which will not be used for planting. How many square planting sections can Maya create, and what is the area of each section in square meters?",
      "answer": "38",
      "full_solution": "First, we need to determine the size of the largest possible square section that can fit evenly into both the length and width of the garden. This requires finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60 and 40.\n\n<<60 \u00f7 20 = 3>>  \n<<40 \u00f7 20 = 2>>  \nGCD(60, 40) = <<20>>20 meters.\n\nSo, each square planting section will be 20 meters by 20 meters.\n\nNext, we account for the walking path. The path is 1 meter wide around the entire perimeter, so it reduces the usable planting area on all sides.\n\nThe effective length for planting is:  \n60 meters \u2013 1 meter (left) \u2013 1 meter (right) = <<60 - 2 = 58>>58 meters.\n\nThe effective width for planting is:  \n40 meters \u2013 1 meter (top) \u2013 1 meter (bottom) = <<40 - 2 = 38>>38 meters.",

      "question": "Maria is opening a small artisanal candle business and needs to determine her pricing strategy. She uses 8 ounces of soy wax per candle and buys wax in 5-pound boxes (1 pound = 16 ounces). Each box costs $24. She also spends $3.50 per candle on essential oils, labels, and wicks. Maria wants to make a profit of $4.50 per candle after covering all costs. She plans to sell each candle for $18.00. However, she must pay a monthly rent of $600 for her workspace, and she estimates that she will sell 120 candles per month. How many candles must she sell each month to break even (cover all her costs including rent)? Also, how much profit will she make if she sells 120 candles?",
